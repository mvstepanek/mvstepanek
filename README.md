Hey! I'm Martin Stepanek, founder of [TechSEO Vitals](https://www.techseovitals.com/) and an experienced technical SEO consultant.

I've spent the last decade as a web developer specializing in website architecture and performance optimization. In 2021, I fully transitioned into technical SEO.

Today, I help businesses optimize their websites through data-driven technical SEO strategies.

I write [a newsletter focused on technical SEO](https://www.techseovitals.com/newsletter/ ) for industry professionals and website owners.

You can find my insights on the [TechSEO Vitals Blog](https://www.techseovitals.com/blog/) and social media platforms.
