# Hey, I'm Martin Stepanek 🏳️‍🌈

I'm a Slovakia-based technical SEO consultant with over a decade of experience in web development and infrastructure.

I'm ready to help you with your website's technical SEO and SEO overall.

Currently, I'm an in-house technical SEO manager at the SaaS company Quality Unit, but I also freelance consult and audit websites.

Also, I enjoy sharing my {technical} SEO knowledge and experience with others.
